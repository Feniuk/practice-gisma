      <p class="text">
        The "Bookshelf" project is a well-structured digital service designed to
        help users easily discover and access books across a variety of
        categories. Developed as part of a collaborative team effort, the
        platform features multiple intuitive sections aimed at enhancing the
        user experience. In this project, I contributed not only as a developer,
        working on core functionality and interface components, but also took on
        the role of Scrum Master, facilitating agile practices, coordinating
        team sprints, and ensuring effective communication throughout the
        development cycle.

      <p class="text">
        The "Vyshyvanka" project is a team-developed website that showcases a
        collection of traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts, known as
        vyshyvankas. The site features a clean and user-friendly layout with
        simple sections, allowing visitors to easily browse through various
        designs and styles. As part of the development team, I contributed to
        building the core structure and ensuring smooth navigation, focusing on
        clarity and visual appeal to highlight the cultural richness of each
        item. The project emphasized teamwork and attention to detail in both
        design and functionality.
